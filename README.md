-   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative, efficient, and flexible. React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by using a component-based approach.
-   Components are reusable pieces of code that can be combined to create complex UIs. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI when components change. This makes React fast and performant.
-   React is used by many popular websites and applications, including Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, and Netflix.
